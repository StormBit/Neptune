#Neptune is a fast, lightweight, easy-to-use content management system written in PHP.

####Features:
- Extensive Support — We understand that different people have different environments and requirements with their web-hosting, and thus we've opted to support as many different web-servers and database backends as possible. (Currently: [MySQL](https://mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/), [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/)).
- Powerful Theming — While our default theme is based upon [Twitter's Bootstrap 2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), with improvements such as adaptive CSS (try visiting [our site](https://dev.stormbit.net/) with your smartphone), Neptune's look and feel can be completely customised to your tastes via our theming system.
- Light and Scalable  — By only running code that needs to be run, and refactoring whenever and wherever possible, Neptune's execution time is only describable as being blazingly fast. Additionally Neptune includes support for numerous caching and load-balancing systems. 
- Highly Modular — Neptune has been built from the ground up to be customisable in every way, by only running what is essential for operation. Everything else is outsourced to modules, which we've implemented to allow rapid, easy development. All the official modules and several example modules are included, and many more will be made available for seperate download. Think of Neptune as being a next-generation framework, as well as a content management system.
- Buzzword Friendly — _NEXT GENERATION MODULAR THEMABLE FLUID RESPONSIVE WEB 2.0 CLOUD DESIGN WITH AJAX, NODE.JS, JAVA, AND DHTML AND A FRAMEWORK IN HTML5._ - [tiffany352](https://twitter.com/tiffany352)
